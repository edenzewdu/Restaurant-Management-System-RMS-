  <p>On a recent trip to Ethiopia I enjoyed exploring the african 
  countryside and meeting those who call it home.</p>
  
  <p>Elias and I walked through one of these gates and met 
an elderly grandmother and her granddaughters. We were invited 
into there gojo bet where I shot these photos of a home that provides 
space for multiple generations on one side and their livestock on the other. 
I was amazed by the efficiency.</p>
<p>Hospitality, warmth and kindness are embedded into
 the African culture. The rich sense of community is what I 
 remember most when I look back on my visits to ethiopia.</p>
